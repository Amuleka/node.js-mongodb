# Overview

In this project, I wanted to interact with a document type database. In this case, I'm using MongoDB to get information from my contacts database objects

I'm using an MVC architecture to separate business logic, API calls, and initialization processes, as well as the connection with the database

I wanted to show how easy it is to interact with a document-type database and make the API calls simple. Node.js is a perfect programming language to interact with these types of databases

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my code editor, the REST Client extension, and express, dot-env, MongoDB, and body-parser npm packages

I used Node.js with MongoDB

# Useful Websites

- [Node.js Web Site](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MongoDb Web Site](https://www.mongodb.com/)

# Future Work

- In a future example I want to show POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- I could show API Documentation so that everyone could have access to these API calls
